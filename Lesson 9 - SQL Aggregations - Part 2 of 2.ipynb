    "`DISTINCT` is always used in `SELECT` statements, and it provides the unique rows for all columns written in the `SELECT` statement. Therefore, you only use `DISTINCT` once in any particular `SELECT` statement.\n",

    "You could write:\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3\n",
    "FROM table1;`\n",
    "which would return the unique (or DISTINCT) rows across all three columns.\n",
