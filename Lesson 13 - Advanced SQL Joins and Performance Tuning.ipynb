The query results should be a table with three columns: the account name (e.g. Johnson Controls), the primary contact name (e.g. Cammy Sosnowski), and the sales representative's name (e.g. Samuel Racine).

    "- Table size\n",

    "- Database software and optimization (e.g. Postgres is optimized differently than Redshift)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips to limit query run time:\n",
    "- Put the `LIMIT` statement in a sub-query to limit data as it is executed first. Not the outer query otherwise it will still just compute the full query and then `LIMIT` the results in the last step. This is redundant.\n",
    "- Limit your query to a small time window if you have time-series data.\n",
    "- Test your query on a subset of data first.\n",
    "- Reduce table sizes first before joining them using pre-aggregations or other filters with `WHERE`.\n",
    "- You can use `EXPLAIN` at the start of your query to see which statements are executed first and how long they take. The modify the steps that are expensive. Then run `EXPLAIN` again to see if time has been reduced.\n",
    "- `FULL JOIN` and `COUNT` run pretty fast. `COUNT(DISTINCT)` is slow.\n"
